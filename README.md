## 🚩 Our Mission

In today's centralized digital world, our data is commoditized, and our voices are censored by tech monopolies. We believe in free speech, data privacy, and digital rights as fundamental human rights.

**Magpie** is a decentralized protocol and social network built to resist censorship and break data silos. We are creating a digital public square where you control your identity, you own your data, and your speech is free.

## 🌟 Our Core Values

This project is, first and foremost, driven by its values. All technical decisions are based on these principles:

* **Freedom:** We defend freedom of speech and the free flow of information. The network is designed to be censorship-resistant, with no central authority capable of unilaterally deleting content or banning users.
* **Privacy:** Privacy is a non-negotiable right. We strictly adhere to high-level privacy standards, ensuring users have full control over their data.
* **Decentralization:** The future of the network should be decided by its users, not a corporation. Self-hosting and P2P technologies ensure no single entity controls the network.
* **Equality:** This is an open and inclusive network for everyone. We respect all identities and expressions.

## ✨ Core Features

* **🛡️ Secure Communication:**
    * **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):** Uses the Signal Protocol for 1:1 and group chats.
    * **Delivery Guarantee:** Ensures messages are delivered reliably.
    * **Offline Storage:** Messages are stored locally and synchronized when online.
    * **Presence:** Online/Read/Typing status indicators.

* **🔐 Data Sovereignty & Privacy:**
    * **Self-Hosting:** You can host your own node. Also hosting provider if not On-premise unless connect to each other, so decentralized support.
    * **Decentralized Support:** Back up message history and permanently store it anywhere you choose, allowing recovery at any time.
    * **Tags & Sorting:** Organize your conversations.

* **🌐 Censorship-Resistant:**
    * **P2P Network:** Nodes communicate directly, making it impossible for a central entity to shut down the network.
    * **Client-Side Muting:** You control your experience. Instead of platform-level censorship, we provide powerful client-side tools to mute, filter, and block content or users you don't want to see.

* **💬 Full-Featured Social Experience:**
    * **1:1 Chat & Group Chat:** Full-featured messaging.
    * **Secondhand Market:** Built-in marketplace features.
    * **Add-ons:** Implement stringent security measures and encryption to prevent data breaches.

## 🌍 Cross-Platform Support

We aim to make Magpie accessible everywhere.

* **💻 Desktop:** Windows, macOS, Linux (Electron / .NET)
* **📱 Mobile:** Android, iOS (Flutter, Kotlin, Swift)
* **🌐 Web:** All modern browsers (Vue, Node.js, Nuxt, TypeScript) - No installation required.

## 🛠️ Architecture & Tech Stack

Magpie's core is a decentralized P2P protocol. To ensure high performance, scalability, and a rich developer ecosystem, anyone can run high-performance nodes or auxiliary services using the following technologies.

* **Web:** Web Client + Management Site (Vue, Node.js, Nuxt, TypeScript)
* **Mini-Programs:** UniApp
* **Android:** Kotlin & C++
* **iOS:** Swift
* **Cross-Platform Mobile:** Flutter
* **Desktop:** Electron / .NET
